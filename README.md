# Axios

Axios is a JavaScript library for making HTTP requests from web browsers or Node.js applications. It simplifies the process of sending asynchronous HTTP requests and handling responses. Axios is often used in web development for tasks such as fetching data from a server, submitting form data, or interacting with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

## Features

- **Promise-based:** Axios uses Promises, providing a clean and structured way to handle asynchronous operations.

- **Browser and Node.js support:** Axios can be used in both browser-based and server-side JavaScript applications.

- **Automatic JSON parsing:** Axios automatically parses JSON responses and allows sending JSON data in requests.

- **Interceptors:** Define interceptors for requests and responses, useful for tasks like adding authentication headers or handling errors globally.

- **Cancel requests:** Axios provides the ability to cancel pending requests.

## Getting Started

To get started with Axios, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Axios via npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   # or
   yarn add axios
